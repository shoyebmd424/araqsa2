Tasbih is a form of dhikr (remembrance of Allah) in Islam, which involves the repetition of specific phrases or prayers. The most common form of tasbih is the "Tasbih of Fatimah," named after the Prophet Muhammad's daughter. It involves the repetition of the phrase "Subhan Allah" (Glory be to Allah), "Alhamdulillah" (Praise be to Allah), and "Allahu Akbar" (Allah is the Greatest) 33 times each, for a total of 99 repetitions. This is often done using a tasbih, a string of beads used to keep track of the number of repetitions. Tasbih is typically done after the obligatory prayers, but can also be done at any time.</p><p>
It is believed that tasbih is a way to purify the soul and increase one's closeness to Allah, it is also considered a way to earn rewards from Allah and to help one to stay away from sins. It is also believed that it helps to focus the mind, and to be mindful of the blessings of Allah. It is also considered a way to gain forgiveness for sins and to be protected from the devil.</p><p>
